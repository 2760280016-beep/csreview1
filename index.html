                exp: "A capacitor acts like a tiny rechargeable battery. In RAM, the presence of a charge represents binary '1' and the absence represents '0'. Because capacitors naturally leak electricity, DRAM needs to be refreshed thousands of times per second.",
                mne: "C for Capacitor, C for Charge. Charge is On (1), No charge is Off (0)."

                exp: "SRAM (Static) uses flip-flops and doesn't need refreshing, making it lightning fast but expensive. DRAM (Dynamic) is what you buy in 8GB/16GB sticks; it's cheaper but needs constant power refreshes.",

                exp: "When your RAM is full, the OS moves 'inactive' data to a hidden file on your SSD/HDD (called a page file). It allows you to run more programs than your RAM physically allows, but it slows the computer down.",

                exp: "The BIOS is the first software that runs when you hit the power button. It checks hardware (POST) and hands control to the Operating System. It must be in ROM so it isn't lost when power is cut.",

                exp: "Instead of one person doing a 100-page job, you give 25 pages to 4 people. In computing, this means multi-core CPUs handling different parts of a program simultaneously.",

                exp: "Think of the FSB as the highway between the CPU and the Memory. Even if you have a fast CPU, a slow FSB will cause a bottleneck.",

                exp: "Word size determines how much data the CPU can process in a single clock cycle and how much memory it can address. Most modern PCs are 64-bit.",

                exp: "RISC (Reduced) is like a chef who only does one basic cut at a time. CISC (Complex) is like a chef who has a single button for 'Make a Sandwich'. RISC is common in phones (ARM), CISC in PCs (Intel).",

                exp: "Primary is your 'active' workspace. Secondary is your 'filing cabinet'. You can't run a program directly from the HDD; it must be loaded into Primary storage first.",

                exp: "Even if a file is only 1 byte, it will take up 1 whole cluster. This is why 'Size on Disk' is often larger than actual file size.",
